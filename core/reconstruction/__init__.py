"""
Refactored evaluation module for ML-based reconstruction.

This module provides clean, modular tools for evaluating event reconstruction
methods with support for:
- Feature importance analysis
- Accuracy metrics with bootstrap confidence intervals
- Binned performance analysis
- Complementarity analysis between methods
- Mass resolution calculations
- Comprehensive visualization tools
